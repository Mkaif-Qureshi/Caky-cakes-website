# Caky-cakes-website
**"Caky Cakes"** is an enticing e-commerce website that offers a delightful range of cakes and bakery products. With its user-friendly and intuitive UI, customers can easily browse through a wide selection of delicious treats, place orders. This is my first web project, and I acknowledge that it may contain some imperfections and I am happy that I learned a lot through this project.
